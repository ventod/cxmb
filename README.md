I'm new to PSP programming, so to learn I made a CXMB mod.

This is a "light" mod of CXMB, for now I did this:
 * Removed random CTF feature
 * Removed FW version detection
    * Needs 6.61 FW
    * Non-6.61 code removed (in progress)
    * Need CTFs made for 6.61 (or converted to 6.61, may also work with 6.60 CTFs)
 * Kept only CXMB *LITE* functionalty (goolge "CXMB lite vs full")
 * Code cleanup
